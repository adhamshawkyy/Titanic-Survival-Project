# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction — Data Science Project

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the famous **Titanic Dataset** to predict passenger survival using **Machine Learning techniques**.
The main goal is to apply the complete **Data Science workflow** — from data cleaning and exploration to model training and evaluation — and gain hands-on experience in building a predictive model with Python.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* Understand and analyze the Titanic dataset structure.
* Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing values effectively.
* Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key features influencing survival.
* Build a **predictive model** that classifies whether a passenger survived or not.
* Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy and other metrics.

## ⚙️ **Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **Pandas** & **NumPy** — for data manipulation and cleaning
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** — for data visualization and insights
* **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** — for model building and evaluation
* **Jupyter Notebook** — for analysis and interactive coding

## 🔍 **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

   * Imported the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
   * Handled missing data (like Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns).
   * Converted categorical variables into numerical form using encoding techniques.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed patterns between features such as gender, class, age, and survival.
   * Visualized insights using bar plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.
   * Found that women and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.

3. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**

   * Created new features (e.g., FamilySize, IsAlone, Title).
   * Normalized and encoded the data for model compatibility.
   * Split data into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**

   * Implemented **Logistic Regression** as the primary model.
   * Trained the model and evaluated its accuracy using test data.
   * Compared results and improved model performance with hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Prediction & Insights**

   * Predicted survival outcomes for unseen passengers.
   * Gained insights into the most influential factors affecting survival.

---

## 📈 **Results**

* Achieved strong accuracy and consistent results with **Logistic Regression**.
* Identified that **Gender, Passenger Class, and Age** were among the most important predictors.
* Visualization clearly showed survival differences across groups.

---

## 🧠 **Key Learnings**

* Importance of **data preprocessing** and **feature selection** in machine learning.
* How to apply **EDA** to understand real-world datasets.
* How to build, train, and evaluate a **classification model** step-by-step.
* Hands-on experience in applying Python libraries for Data Science.

## 🏁 **About**

This is my **first Data Science project**, marking the official start of my journey into the world of data and machine learning.
Through this project, I took my first real steps in exploring, analyzing, and understanding how data can be transformed into valuable insights.
It’s more than just a project — it’s the beginning of a path I’m passionate about, where I aim to keep learning, improving, and creating smarter solutions with data.
My **Best** Didn't Come **Yet** 💪✨
